## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have deployed a complete production-grade application stack featuring:

- **Multi-service application** running on Kubernetes
- **Production networking** with Ingress and TLS termination  
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards
- **Database persistence** with PostgreSQL and Redis
- **Professional DevOps workflows** using GitOps and automation

This mirrors the same infrastructure patterns used by companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and GitHub to serve millions of users.

## Learning Philosophy

Rather than just copying commands, you'll understand the **why** behind each decision. Each milestone builds upon the previous one, teaching you to think like a platform engineer who designs systems for scale, reliability, and maintainability.

## Prerequisites: Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we begin, you need several tools installed on your machine. This setup process is crucial - taking time here will save hours of troubleshooting later.

### Required Tools Installation

**For macOS (Recommended path):**
```bash
# Install all tools at once using Homebrew
brew install docker docker-compose kubectl k3d helm nodejs jq

# Start Docker Desktop (required for container operations)
# Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
```

**For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# Update your system first
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker  # Apply group changes immediately

# Install kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

# Install k3d (lightweight Kubernetes)
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash

# Install Helm (Kubernetes package manager)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash

# Install Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs jq
```

### Verification Checkpoint ✅

Run these commands to verify everything is installed correctly:

```bash
# Check all tools are properly installed
docker --version    # Should show: Docker version 20.0+
kubectl version --client  # Should show: Client Version v1.28+
k3d version        # Should show: k3d version v5.6+
helm version       # Should show: version.BuildInfo
node --version     # Should show: v18+
```

**Success indicators:**
- All commands return version numbers without errors
- Docker Desktop is running (you can see the whale icon in your system tray)
- You have at least 4GB of available RAM and 10GB of disk space

### Common Installation Issues & Fixes

**Docker permission errors on Linux:**
```bash
# If you get "permission denied" errors:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
# Then test: docker run hello-world
```

**kubectl not found:**
```bash
# Ensure kubectl is in your PATH
echo $PATH
# If missing, add to your shell profile:
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## Milestone 0 — Environment Setup

**Learning Objective:** Verify all required tools are installed and system resources meet minimum requirements for Kubernetes operations.

**Why this matters:** Proper tool installation and resource availability prevent hours of troubleshooting later. This milestone ensures your development environment is production-ready.

### Step 0.1 — Verify Tools

### Step 0.2 — Resource Checks

**System Resource Verification:**
```bash
# Check Docker daemon status
docker info

# Check available memory (macOS)
vm_stat

# Check disk space
df -h
```

**✅ Current Status (2024-08-20):**
- **Docker Daemon**: ✅ Running (6 containers active)
- **Backend**: Colima (Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS)
- **RAM**: 1.92GiB total ⚠️ (Below 4GB recommendation)
- **Disk**: 932GB total, 581GB available ✅ (Exceeds 10GB requirement)

**⚠️ Resource Warning:** System has only 1.92GB RAM, which may cause performance issues during Kubernetes cluster operations. Consider:
- Closing unnecessary applications
- Using smaller cluster configurations
- Monitoring resource usage during operations

### ✅ Checkpoint

Your environment is ready when:
- ✅ All 7 required tools show version numbers
- ✅ Docker daemon is running and accessible
- ✅ At least 4GB RAM available (⚠️ Current: 1.92GB)
- ✅ At least 10GB disk space available (✅ Current: 581GB)
- ✅ No permission or PATH errors

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Docker Permission Errors:**

# If you get "permission denied" errors:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
# Then test: docker run hello-world
```

**kubectl Not Found:**
```bash
# Ensure kubectl is in your PATH
echo $PATH
# If missing, add to your shell profile:
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Docker Desktop Missing (macOS):**
```bash
# Alternative: Use Colima (already configured)
brew install colima
colima start --cpu 2 --memory 4 --disk 20

# Or install Docker Desktop from:
# https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
```

*Environment setup completed on 2024-08-20. All tools verified, resources assessed, ready for Milestone 1.*

---

## Milestone 1: Verify Your Application Works with Docker Compose

**Learning Objective:** Confirm your application runs correctly in containers before moving to Kubernetes complexity.

**Why this matters:** Many Kubernetes deployment issues stem from application problems that existed in Docker Compose. By verifying everything works here first, you eliminate one major source of troubleshooting later.

### Step 1.1: Clone and Start Your Application

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/humor-memory-game

# Build all container images
docker-compose build

# Start all services in background
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for services to initialize (databases need time to start)
sleep 30
```

### Step 1.2: Verify Services Are Running

```bash
# Check that all containers are running
docker-compose ps

# You should see 5 services running:
# - frontend: Up, port 3000
# - backend: Up, port 3001  
# - postgres: Up, port 5432
# - redis: Up, port 6379
# - nginx: Up, ports 80, 443
```

### Step 1.3: Test Your Application in Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see:

- ✅ **Game interface loads** with the title "Humor Memory Game"
- ✅ **Username input** and difficulty selection work
- ✅ **Start Game button** is clickable
- ✅ **No connection errors** in the browser console (F12 to check)

**Test the full workflow:**
```bash
# Test backend API health
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}

# Test frontend serves properly  
curl http://localhost:3000/
# Should return HTML content

# Test database connectivity
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U gameuser -d humor_memory_game -c "SELECT version();"
# Should return PostgreSQL version info
```

### Checkpoint ✅

Your Docker Compose application is working when:
- All containers show "Up" status in `docker-compose ps`
- Frontend loads at `http://localhost:3000` without errors
- You can start a game and see emoji cards
- API health endpoint returns success
- Database connection works

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue: Containers keep restarting**
```bash
# Check logs for the problematic service
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs postgres

# Common fix: Wait longer for database initialization
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
sleep 60  # Give more time for startup
```

**Issue: Frontend shows "Cannot connect to game server"**
```bash
# Verify backend is accessible
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Check backend logs for errors
docker-compose logs backend

# Restart just the backend if needed
docker-compose restart backend
```

### Clean Up Before Moving Forward

```bash
# Stop all services (but keep data)
docker-compose down

# Verify everything is stopped
docker-compose ps
# Should show no running containers
```

### What You Learned

You've confirmed that your application works correctly in containers, including:
- **Multi-service orchestration** with Docker Compose
- **Database connectivity** between application and PostgreSQL
- **Caching integration** with Redis
- **Frontend-backend communication** through nginx proxy

### Professional Skills Gained

- **Container orchestration** fundamentals
- **Service dependency management** (databases must start before applications)
- **Health check verification** to confirm services are truly ready
- **Debugging containerized applications** using logs and direct testing

---

## Milestone 2: Deploy to Kubernetes

**Learning Objective:** Transform your Docker Compose application into a Kubernetes deployment, understanding the fundamental differences in how Kubernetes manages applications.

**Why this matters:** This milestone teaches you the core Kubernetes concepts that every platform engineer needs to know: Pods, Services, Deployments, and ConfigMaps.

### Step 2.1: Create Your Kubernetes Cluster

```bash
# Create a local 3-node Kubernetes cluster
k3d cluster create dev-cluster \
  --servers 1 \
  --agents 2 \
  --port "8080:80@loadbalancer" \
  --port "8443:443@loadbalancer"

# Verify cluster is running
kubectl get nodes
# Should show 3 nodes: 1 server, 2 agents, all "Ready"

# Check cluster health
kubectl cluster-info
# Should show cluster endpoint and DNS
```

**Understanding what happened:** You just created a mini Kubernetes cluster on your laptop. The `--port` flags expose cluster ports 80 and 443 to your localhost ports 8080 and 8443, allowing external access.

### Step 2.2: Deploy Your Application Configuration

Kubernetes uses ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage application configuration, replacing the `.env` file approach from Docker Compose.

```bash
# Create the application namespace (organization)
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml

# Create configuration and secrets
kubectl apply -f k8s/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/secrets.yaml

# Verify they were created
kubectl get configmap -n humor-game
kubectl get secrets -n humor-game
```

**Understanding ConfigMaps vs Secrets:** ConfigMaps store non-sensitive configuration (database names, ports), while Secrets store sensitive data (passwords, API keys) with base64 encoding.

### Step 2.3: Deploy Database Services

Databases must start before your application, just like in Docker Compose.

```bash
# Deploy PostgreSQL with persistent storage
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres.yaml

# Deploy Redis for caching
kubectl apply -f k8s/redis.yaml

# Wait for databases to be ready (this takes time!)
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=postgres -n humor-game --timeout=180s
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=redis -n humor-game --timeout=60s

# Verify databases are running
kubectl get pods -n humor-game
# Should show postgres and redis pods with "1/1 Running"
```

**Understanding Persistent Storage:** The PostgreSQL deployment creates a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to ensure your data survives pod restarts, unlike temporary container storage.

### Step 2.4: Deploy Application Services

```bash
# Deploy backend API service
kubectl apply -f k8s/backend.yaml

# Deploy frontend web service  
kubectl apply -f k8s/frontend.yaml

# Wait for applications to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=backend -n humor-game --timeout=120s
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=frontend -n humor-game --timeout=60s

# Check all pods are running
kubectl get pods -n humor-game
# Should show 4 pods all with "1/1 Running" status
```

### Step 2.5: Set Up Ingress Controller for External Access

An Ingress Controller acts like nginx in Docker Compose, routing external traffic to your services.

```bash
# Install nginx-ingress controller
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.8.2/deploy/static/provider/baremetal/deploy.yaml

# Wait for ingress controller to be ready
kubectl wait --namespace ingress-nginx \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/component=controller \
  --timeout=120s

# Deploy your application's ingress rules
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml

# Verify ingress is configured
kubectl get ingress -n humor-game
```

### Step 2.6: Test Your Kubernetes Application

**Method 1: Port Forwarding (Development Testing)**
```bash
# Forward frontend service to your laptop
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8080:80 -n humor-game &

# Forward backend service for API testing
kubectl port-forward svc/backend 3001:3001 -n humor-game &

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

**Method 2: Ingress Access (Production-like)**
```bash
# Test through ingress controller
curl -H "Host: gameapp.local" http://localhost:8080/

# Test API routing
curl -H "Host: gameapp.local" http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

### Checkpoint ✅

Your Kubernetes deployment is working when:
- All 4 pods show "1/1 Running" status
- Frontend loads at `http://localhost:8080` through port-forward
- You can start a game and play without errors
- Backend API responds to health checks
- Ingress routes traffic correctly to both frontend and backend

### Verify Full Application Functionality

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and test:
- ✅ **Game interface loads** properly
- ✅ **Username and difficulty selection** work
- ✅ **Start game button** creates a new game
- ✅ **Card flipping and matching** function correctly
- ✅ **Leaderboard tab** shows sample data
- ✅ **No connection errors** in browser console

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue: Pods stuck in "Pending" status**
```bash
# Check what's wrong
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n humor-game

# Common cause: Insufficient resources
kubectl top nodes  # Check resource usage
```

**Issue: Backend can't connect to database**
```bash
# Check backend logs
kubectl logs -l app=backend -n humor-game

# Verify database service exists
kubectl get svc postgres -n humor-game

# Test database connectivity
kubectl exec -it deployment/postgres -n humor-game -- psql -U gameuser -d humor_memory_game -c "SELECT 1;"
```

**Issue: Frontend shows connection errors**
```bash
# Check if backend service is reachable
kubectl get endpoints backend -n humor-game

# Test backend health directly
kubectl port-forward svc/backend 3001:3001 -n humor-game &
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### Understanding the Differences: Docker Compose vs Kubernetes

| Aspect | Docker Compose | Kubernetes |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Configuration** | `.env` files | ConfigMaps + Secrets |
| **Networking** | Bridge networks | Services + DNS |
| **Storage** | Named volumes | PersistentVolumeClaims |
| **Load Balancing** | nginx container | Services + Ingress |
| **Health Checks** | Container health | Readiness + Liveness probes |
| **Scaling** | Manual replica counts | Horizontal Pod Autoscaler |

### What You Learned

You've successfully migrated a multi-service application from Docker Compose to Kubernetes, understanding:
- **Pod orchestration** and how containers run in Kubernetes
- **Service discovery** and how applications find each other
- **Configuration management** with ConfigMaps and Secrets
- **Persistent storage** for stateful applications like databases
- **Ingress routing** for external access to your applications

### Professional Skills Gained

- **Kubernetes fundamentals** that form the foundation of container orchestration
- **Service mesh basics** through Kubernetes service discovery
- **Configuration as code** practices for managing application settings
- **Infrastructure debugging** skills for troubleshooting complex deployments

---

## Milestone 3: Production-Grade Access and Security

**Learning Objective:** Transform your local-only application into one that can serve real users with proper domain routing, TLS certificates, and production networking patterns.

**Why this matters:** This milestone bridges the gap between "it works on my laptop" and "it works for thousands of users." You'll implement the same networking patterns used by major web applications.

### Step 3.1: Set Up Local Domain for Testing

Before deploying to a real domain, we'll test with a local domain to understand the concepts.

```bash
# Add local domain to your hosts file
echo "127.0.0.1 gameapp.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

# Verify DNS resolution works
ping gameapp.local
# Should ping 127.0.0.1 successfully
```

### Step 3.2: Test Production-Style Access

```bash
# Test your application through the ingress with domain
curl -H "Host: gameapp.local" http://localhost:8080/

# Test API routing specifically  
curl -H "Host: gameapp.local" http://localhost:8080/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}

# Test in browser with domain
open http://gameapp.local:8080
```

**Understanding Host Headers:** The `-H "Host: gameapp.local"` tells the ingress controller which virtual host rules to apply, just like how nginx handles multiple domains on one server.

### Step 3.3: (Optional) Set Up Real Domain Access

If you have a domain name, you can set up real production access:

**Prerequisites:**
- A domain name you own (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
- Access to your domain's DNS settings

```bash
# Point your domain to your public IP (if you have one)
# In your DNS provider, create an A record:
# Name: game.yourdomain.com
# Value: Your public IP address

# Update the ingress to use your real domain
# Edit k8s/ingress.yaml and replace gameapp.local with game.yourdomain.com
# Then apply the changes:
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
```

### Step 3.4: Understanding Production Networking

**Traffic Flow in Your Setup:**
```
User Browser (gameapp.local:8080)
    ↓
k3d LoadBalancer (port 8080 → cluster port 80)
    ↓  
nginx-ingress Controller (routes by Host header)
    ↓
Frontend Service (for / paths) OR Backend Service (for /api/* paths)
    ↓
Frontend Pod OR Backend Pod
```

**Key Networking Concepts:**
- **Ingress Controller:** Acts like a smart reverse proxy that routes traffic based on hostname and path
- **Services:** Provide stable IP addresses and load balancing for pods
- **Host-based routing:** Different domains can point to different applications
- **Path-based routing:** Different URL paths can go to different services

### Step 3.5: Monitor Traffic Flow

```bash
# Watch ingress controller logs to see traffic
kubectl logs -f -n ingress-nginx deployment/ingress-nginx-controller

# In another terminal, generate some traffic
curl -H "Host: gameapp.local" http://localhost:8080/
curl -H "Host: gameapp.local" http://localhost:8080/api/health

# You should see access logs showing your requests
```

### Checkpoint ✅

Your production networking is working when:
- Domain `gameapp.local` resolves to your local machine
- Application loads at `http://gameapp.local:8080` in browser
- API calls route correctly to backend (check `/api/health`)
- Ingress controller logs show your traffic
- Game functionality works the same as before

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue: Domain doesn't resolve**
```bash
# Check hosts file entry
cat /etc/hosts | grep gameapp.local

# Should show: 127.0.0.1 gameapp.local
# If missing, add it:
echo "127.0.0.1 gameapp.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

**Issue: 404 Not Found errors**
```bash
# Check ingress configuration
kubectl describe ingress humor-game-ingress -n humor-game

# Verify ingress controller is running
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

# Check ingress rules match your requests
kubectl get ingress -n humor-game -o yaml
```

**Issue: API calls return 502 Bad Gateway**
```bash
# Check backend service has endpoints
kubectl get endpoints backend -n humor-game

# Verify backend pods are healthy
kubectl get pods -l app=backend -n humor-game
kubectl logs -l app=backend -n humor-game
```

### Production Networking Best Practices

**What you've implemented:**
- **Host-based routing:** Different domains for different applications
- **Path-based routing:** API and frontend traffic separation  
- **Service discovery:** Automatic load balancing across pod replicas
- **Health checking:** Ingress only routes to healthy pods

**What production adds:**
- **TLS termination:** HTTPS certificates handled at ingress
- **Rate limiting:** Protection against traffic spikes
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Security filtering
- **Global load balancing:** Traffic distribution across regions

### What You Learned

You've implemented enterprise-grade networking patterns:
- **Ingress controllers** for sophisticated traffic routing
- **Host and path-based routing** for multi-service applications
- **Service discovery** for automatic load balancing
- **Production traffic flow** from internet to application pods

### Professional Skills Gained

- **Load balancer configuration** used by every major web application
- **Domain and DNS management** for production deployments
- **Traffic routing patterns** that scale to millions of requests
- **Network debugging skills** for complex multi-service applications

## Milestone 4: Comprehensive Observability and Monitoring

**Learning Objective:** Implement production-grade monitoring that gives you complete visibility into your application's health, performance, and user behavior.

**Why this matters:** Monitoring isn't optional in production. This milestone teaches you the same observability patterns used by companies like Datadog and New Relic to track application performance and prevent outages before they happen.

### Step 4.1: Deploy Monitoring Infrastructure

The monitoring stack includes Prometheus (metrics collection) and Grafana (visualization dashboards).

```bash
# Create monitoring namespace and RBAC permissions
kubectl apply -f k8s/prometheus-rbac.yaml

# Deploy Prometheus and Grafana stack
kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring.yaml

# Wait for monitoring services to be ready (this takes a few minutes)
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=prometheus -n monitoring --timeout=300s
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=grafana -n monitoring --timeout=300s

# Verify monitoring stack is running
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
# Should show prometheus and grafana pods with "1/1 Running"
```

**Understanding the Monitoring Stack:**
- **Prometheus:** Collects and stores metrics from your applications
- **Grafana:** Creates visual dashboards from Prometheus data
- **ServiceMonitor:** Tells Prometheus which applications to monitor

### Step 4.2: Access Your Monitoring Dashboards

```bash
# Access Prometheus (metrics database)
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090 -n monitoring &

# Access Grafana (dashboard interface)
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000 -n monitoring &

# Open monitoring interfaces
open http://localhost:9090  # Prometheus UI
open http://localhost:3000  # Grafana UI (login: admin/admin123)
```

### Step 4.3: Explore Prometheus Metrics

Open `http://localhost:9090` and explore the metrics Prometheus is collecting:

**Basic queries to try:**
```bash
# In Prometheus query interface, try these:

# Pod CPU usage
rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])

# Pod memory usage  
container_memory_usage_bytes

# HTTP requests to your backend
rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Kubernetes pod restarts
increase(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total[1h])
```

**Understanding Metrics:** Each query returns time-series data showing how values change over time. This forms the foundation for alerting and capacity planning.

### Step 4.4: Create Your First Grafana Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3000` and login with `admin/admin123`.

**Create a new dashboard:**
1. Click the "+" icon and select "Create Dashboard"
2. Click "Add a new panel"
3. Add these panels one by one:

**Panel 1: Pod CPU Usage**
```bash
# Query: 
rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace="humor-game"}[5m])

# Panel title: "Pod CPU Usage"
# Unit: "percent (0.0-1.0)"
```

**Panel 2: Pod Memory Usage**
```bash
# Query:
container_memory_usage_bytes{namespace="humor-game"}

# Panel title: "Pod Memory Usage"  
# Unit: "bytes"
```

**Panel 3: HTTP Request Rate**
```bash
# Query:
rate(nginx_ingress_controller_requests[5m])

# Panel title: "HTTP Requests per Second"
# Unit: "reqps"
```

**Panel 4: Pod Status**
```bash
# Query:
kube_pod_status_phase{namespace="humor-game"}

# Panel title: "Pod Status"
# Visualization: "Stat"
```

### Step 4.5: Generate Load to See Metrics

Create some traffic to populate your dashboards:

```bash
# Generate continuous load to see metrics change
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -H "Host: gameapp.local" http://localhost:8080/ > /dev/null 2>&1
  curl -H "Host: gameapp.local" http://localhost:8080/api/health > /dev/null 2>&1
  sleep 1
done
```

**Watch your dashboards update** - you should see:
- ✅ **CPU usage increase** during the load test
- ✅ **HTTP request rate spike** in the request panel
- ✅ **Memory usage remain stable** (well-behaved application)
- ✅ **All pods remain healthy** during load

### Step 4.6: Set Up Application-Specific Metrics

Your backend can expose custom metrics about game activity:

```bash
# Check if your backend exposes metrics
curl http://localhost:3001/metrics

# If not available, your backend would need code like this added:
# (This is for reference - the actual backend files contain this)
#
# const promClient = require('prom-client');
# app.get('/metrics', async (req, res) => {
#   res.set('Content-Type', promClient.register.contentType);
#   res.end(await promClient.register.metrics());
# });
```

**Business Metrics Dashboard Panel:**
```bash
# Query: Number of active game sessions
game_sessions_active

# Query: Game completion rate  
rate(games_completed_total[5m])

# Query: Average game duration
histogram_quantile(0.5, rate(game_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
```

### Checkpoint ✅

Your monitoring is working when:
- Prometheus collects metrics at `http://localhost:9090`
- Grafana shows dashboards at `http://localhost:3000`
- CPU and memory panels show data for your pods
- HTTP request panels show traffic spikes during load tests
- You can create and modify dashboard panels
- Metrics update in real-time as you use the application

### Understanding Production Monitoring

**The Three Pillars of Observability:**
1. **Metrics:** Numerical data over time (CPU, memory, request rates)
2. **Logs:** Event records with context (error messages, user actions)  
3. **Traces:** Request flow through distributed services

**Key Metrics Categories:**
- **RED Metrics:** Rate, Errors, Duration (user-facing performance)
- **USE Metrics:** Utilization, Saturation, Errors (resource health)
- **Business Metrics:** Game sessions, user signups, revenue

### Common Monitoring Issues & Fixes

**Issue: No metrics showing in Grafana**
```bash
# Check Prometheus is scraping targets
# Go to http://localhost:9090/targets
# All targets should show "UP" status

# Check ServiceMonitor configuration
kubectl get servicemonitor -n monitoring

# Verify pods have metric endpoints
kubectl get endpoints -n humor-game
```

**Issue: Grafana shows "No data"**
```bash
# Test Prometheus data source in Grafana
# Go to Configuration -> Data Sources -> Test
# Should show "Data source is working"

# Check Prometheus has data
# In Prometheus UI, try query: up
# Should return 1 for healthy targets
```

**Issue: Dashboards are empty**
```bash
# Verify correct namespace in queries
# Query should include: {namespace="humor-game"}

# Check metric names are correct
# In Prometheus, use "Metrics" dropdown to see available metrics

# Generate some traffic to create data
curl -H "Host: gameapp.local" http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

### Production Monitoring Best Practices

**Alerting Strategy:**
- **Critical:** Application down, database unavailable
- **Warning:** High CPU usage, slow response times
- **Info:** Deployment completed, scaling events

**Dashboard Design:**
- **Overview:** System health at a glance
- **Detail:** Deep-dive into specific services
- **Business:** User-facing metrics and KPIs

### What You Learned

You've implemented enterprise observability:
- **Metrics collection** with Prometheus for time-series data
- **Data visualization** with Grafana for operational dashboards  
- **Custom dashboards** tailored to your application's needs
- **Load testing** to validate monitoring under stress
- **Production monitoring patterns** used by major technology companies

### Professional Skills Gained

- **Observability architecture** that scales to thousands of services
- **Dashboard creation** for different stakeholder audiences
- **Metrics-driven debugging** to identify performance bottlenecks
- **Capacity planning** using historical resource utilization data

## Milestone 5: GitOps and Automated Deployments

**Learning Objective:** Implement GitOps workflows that automatically deploy your applications when code changes, following the same patterns used by platform teams at major technology companies.

**Why this matters:** Manual deployments don't scale. This milestone teaches you how to build deployment pipelines that are reliable, auditable, and can be trusted with production systems.

### Step 5.1: Understanding GitOps Principles

**GitOps Core Concepts:**
- **Git as single source of truth:** All configuration is stored in Git repositories
- **Declarative configuration:** Describe desired state, not deployment steps
- **Automated synchronization:** Tools automatically apply Git changes to clusters
- **Observable deployments:** All changes are tracked and auditable

### Step 5.2: Install ArgoCD

ArgoCD is a GitOps operator that watches Git repositories and automatically applies changes to Kubernetes.

```bash
# Create ArgoCD namespace
kubectl create namespace argocd

# Install ArgoCD
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

# Wait for ArgoCD to be ready (this takes several minutes)
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -n argocd --timeout=300s

# Get the initial admin password
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
# Save this password - you'll need it to login

# Access ArgoCD UI
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443 &
open https://localhost:8080
# Login with username: admin, password: (from above command)
```

### Step 5.3: Set Up GitOps Repository Structure

For GitOps to work, you need a repository structure that separates application code from deployment configuration.

**Create a new GitOps repository** (this would be separate from your application code):

```bash
# Example repository structure:
gitops-humor-game/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   │   └── values.yaml
│   ├── staging/
│   │   ├── kustomization.yaml  
│   │   └── values.yaml
│   └── prod/
│       ├── kustomization.yaml
│       └── values.yaml
├── base/
│   ├── backend.yaml        # Copy from your k8s/ directory
│   ├── frontend.yaml       # Copy from your k8s/ directory
│   ├── postgres.yaml       # Copy from your k8s/ directory
│   ├── redis.yaml          # Copy from your k8s/ directory
│   └── kustomization.yaml
└── applications/
    ├── dev-app.yaml
    ├── staging-app.yaml
    └── prod-app.yaml
```

**Important Note:** Use the actual working YAML files from your `k8s/` directory as the base. Don't create simplified versions - GitOps works best with your tested, complete configurations.

### Step 5.4: Create Your First GitOps Application

**Create an ArgoCD Application for your dev environment:**

```yaml
# applications/dev-app.yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: humor-game-dev
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/yourusername/gitops-humor-game
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: environments/dev
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: humor-game
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
```

```bash
# Apply the application to ArgoCD
kubectl apply -f applications/dev-app.yaml

# Check application status
kubectl get applications -n argocd
```

### Step 5.5: Test GitOps Workflow

**Make a change and watch it deploy automatically:**

```bash
# In your GitOps repository, update an environment value
# For example, change replica count in environments/dev/kustomization.yaml

# Commit and push the change
git add environments/dev/kustomization.yaml
git commit -m "Scale backend to 2 replicas"
git push

# Watch ArgoCD detect and apply the change
kubectl get applications -n argocd -w
# Should show sync status changing from "Synced" to "OutOfSync" to "Synced"

# Verify the change was applied
kubectl get pods -n humor-game
# Should show new number of backend replicas
```

### Step 5.6: Environment Promotion Pipeline

**Create a promotion script for moving changes between environments:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# promote.sh - Promote between environments

FROM_ENV=$1
TO_ENV=$2

if [ -z "$FROM_ENV" ] || [ -z "$TO_ENV" ]; then
  echo "Usage: ./promote.sh <from-env> <to-env>"
  echo "Example: ./promote.sh dev staging"
  exit 1
fi

# Get image tags from source environment
BACKEND_TAG=$(grep "newTag:" environments/$FROM_ENV/kustomization.yaml | awk '{print $2}')
FRONTEND_TAG=$(grep "newTag:" environments/$FROM_ENV/kustomization.yaml | awk '{print $2}')

# Update target environment
sed -i "s/newTag: .*/newTag: $BACKEND_TAG/g" environments/$TO_ENV/kustomization.yaml

# Commit changes
git add environments/$TO_ENV/
git commit -m "Promote $FROM_ENV to $TO_ENV: $BACKEND_TAG"
git push

echo "✅ Promoted $FROM_ENV to $TO_ENV successfully"
echo "🔄 ArgoCD will sync the changes automatically"
```

### Checkpoint ✅

Your GitOps workflow is working when:
- ArgoCD UI shows your application with "Synced" status
- Changes to Git repository trigger automatic deployments
- Application pods restart with new configuration
- Promotion script successfully moves changes between environments
- All deployments are visible in ArgoCD UI with full audit trail

### Understanding GitOps Benefits

**Compared to manual deployments:**
- **Reliability:** Declarative configuration eliminates deployment steps errors
- **Auditability:** All changes tracked in Git with author and timestamp
- **Rollback:** Easy to revert to any previous Git commit
- **Consistency:** Same deployment process across all environments

**Production GitOps patterns:**
- **Pull-based deployments:** Cluster pulls changes rather than external push
- **Multi-environment promotion:** Automated progression from dev → staging → prod
- **Policy enforcement:** Validation and security scanning before deployment
- **Secret management:** External secret operators for sensitive data

### Common GitOps Issues & Fixes

**Issue: ArgoCD shows "Unknown" status**
```bash
# Check ArgoCD can access your Git repository
# In ArgoCD UI, go to Settings -> Repositories
# Add your repository with proper credentials

# For public repos, use HTTPS URL
# For private repos, add SSH key or access token
```

**Issue: Application won't sync**
```bash
# Check application configuration
kubectl describe application humor-game-dev -n argocd

# Check ArgoCD logs
kubectl logs deployment/argocd-application-controller -n argocd

# Manual sync from UI or CLI
argocd app sync humor-game-dev
```

**Issue: Kustomization errors**
```bash
# Test kustomization locally
cd environments/dev
kubectl kustomize .

# Check for YAML syntax errors
kubectl apply --dry-run=client -k .
```

### Production GitOps Considerations

**Security:**
- **RBAC:** Limit ArgoCD permissions to specific namespaces
- **Signed commits:** Verify authenticity of deployment changes
- **Image scanning:** Validate container images before deployment
- **Policy enforcement:** Use OPA Gatekeeper for compliance

**Operations:**
- **Multi-cluster:** Manage deployments across multiple Kubernetes clusters
- **Progressive delivery:** Canary and blue-green deployment strategies  
- **Disaster recovery:** GitOps-based cluster bootstrapping
- **Secrets management:** External secret operators (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

### What You Learned

You've implemented professional GitOps workflows:
- **Declarative deployments** using ArgoCD for automatic synchronization
- **Multi-environment management** with promotion pipelines
- **Audit trails** for all deployment changes through Git history
- **Self-healing deployments** that automatically correct configuration drift
- **Production-ready patterns** used by platform teams at scale

### Professional Skills Gained

- **GitOps architecture** that separates application code from deployment configuration
- **Automated deployment pipelines** that reduce manual errors and deployment time
- **Environment promotion strategies** for safe progression of changes
- **Infrastructure as code** practices that make deployments repeatable and reliable

## Milestone 6: Global Scale and Production Readiness

**Learning Objective:** Deploy your application with global reach using CDN, implement production security practices, and understand how to scale to handle enterprise-level traffic.

**Why this matters:** This milestone transforms your local application into one that can serve users globally with the same performance and reliability patterns used by companies like Cloudflare and AWS.

### Prerequisites for Global Deployment

**Required for this milestone:**
- A domain name you own ($10-15/year from any registrar)
- Cloudflare account (free tier is sufficient)
- Public server or cloud instance (optional for full global deployment)

**Note:** You can complete most of this milestone locally to understand the concepts, then apply them to a real production environment when ready.

### Step 6.1: Domain and DNS Setup

**Configure your domain with Cloudflare:**

1. **Add your domain to Cloudflare:**
   - Login to Cloudflare dashboard
   - Click "Add Site" and enter your domain
   - Choose the free plan
   - Update nameservers at your domain registrar

2. **Configure DNS records:**
   ```bash
   # In Cloudflare dashboard, add A record:
   # Type: A
   # Name: game (creates game.yourdomain.com)
   # Content: Your server's public IP
   # Proxy: Enabled (orange cloud icon)
   ```

### Step 6.2: Install cert-manager for Automatic SSL

Production applications need automatic SSL certificate management.

```bash
# Install cert-manager for automatic SSL certificates
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.0/cert-manager.yaml

# Wait for cert-manager to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=cert-manager -n cert-manager --timeout=120s

# Create ClusterIssuer for Let's Encrypt
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: your-email@example.com  # Replace with your email
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
EOF
```

### Step 6.3: Update Ingress for Production Domain

**Modify your ingress to use your real domain:**

```yaml
# Update k8s/ingress.yaml to include your domain
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: humor-game-ingress
  namespace: humor-game
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - game.yourdomain.com  # Replace with your actual domain
    secretName: gameapp-prod-tls
  rules:
  - host: game.yourdomain.com  # Replace with your actual domain
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /api
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: backend
            port:
              number: 3001
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: frontend
            port:
              number: 80
```

```bash
# Apply the updated ingress
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml

# Watch certificate creation
kubectl get certificates -n humor-game -w
# Should show certificate being issued and eventually "Ready: True"
```

### Step 6.4: Configure Cloudflare Performance Optimization

**Enable performance features in Cloudflare dashboard:**

1. **Caching Configuration:**
   - Static assets (images, CSS, JS): Cache for 1 month
   - API endpoints: Cache for 5 minutes  
   - HTML pages: Cache for 1 hour

2. **Performance Settings:**
   - Enable Brotli compression
   - Enable Minification (CSS, JS, HTML)
   - Enable HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
   - Turn on "Always Use HTTPS"

3. **Page Rules for Optimal Caching:**
   ```
   game.yourdomain.com/static/*
   - Cache Level: Cache Everything
   - Edge Cache TTL: 1 month
   
   game.yourdomain.com/api/*  
   - Cache Level: Cache Everything
   - Edge Cache TTL: 5 minutes
   
   game.yourdomain.com/*
   - Cache Level: Standard
   - Edge Cache TTL: 1 hour
   ```

### Step 6.5: Test Global Performance

**Test your application from multiple locations:**

```bash
# Test SSL certificate
curl -I https://game.yourdomain.com/
# Should show 200 OK with valid SSL certificate

# Test API through CDN
curl https://game.yourdomain.com/api/health
# Should return your health check response

# Test performance from different regions using online tools:
# - WebPageTest.org (test from multiple global locations)
# - GTmetrix (performance scoring)
# - Pingdom (uptime monitoring)
```

**Performance metrics to monitor:**
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** Should be <200ms globally
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Should be <2.5s
- **First Input Delay (FID):** Should be <100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Should be <0.1

### Step 6.6: Set Up Global Monitoring

**Add global performance monitoring to your Grafana dashboards:**

```bash
# Create a new dashboard panel for global metrics
# Query examples for CDN performance:

# CDN cache hit ratio
cloudflare_cache_hit_ratio

# Global response time by region  
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Traffic distribution by country
increase(cloudflare_requests_by_country[1h])

# SSL certificate expiry monitoring
(cert_expiry_timestamp - time()) / (24*3600)
```

### Checkpoint ✅

Your global deployment is working when:
- Application loads at `https://game.yourdomain.com` with valid SSL
- Cloudflare shows traffic statistics in their dashboard
- SSL certificate auto-renews (check cert-manager logs)
- Performance tests show <200ms response times globally
- CDN cache hit ratios are >80% for static content
- Monitoring dashboards show global performance metrics

### Understanding Global Scale Architecture

**Your traffic flow now includes:**
```
Global User
    ↓
Cloudflare Edge (nearest location)
    ↓ (cache miss)
Your Origin Server
    ↓
Kubernetes Ingress
    ↓
Application Pods
```

**Benefits of this architecture:**
- **Global performance:** CDN serves content from edge locations near users
- **Automatic scaling:** Cloudflare handles traffic spikes without origin load
- **DDoS protection:** Built-in protection against malicious traffic
- **SSL management:** Automatic certificate renewal and strong security
- **Analytics:** Detailed insights into global user behavior

### Production Security Considerations

**Security features now active:**
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Filters malicious requests
- **DDoS protection:** Automatic mitigation of attack traffic
- **Bot management:** Distinguishes legitimate users from bots
- **Rate limiting:** Prevents abuse of your API endpoints
- **Always Use HTTPS:** Encrypts all traffic end-to-end

### Cost Optimization for Global Scale

**Cloudflare free tier includes:**
- Unlimited bandwidth
- Global CDN
- Basic DDoS protection
- Shared SSL certificates
- Basic analytics

**Optimization strategies:**
- **Cache everything possible:** Reduces origin server load
- **Optimize images:** Use Cloudflare Polish for automatic compression
- **Minimize API calls:** Cache responses appropriately
- **Use workers:** Run code at the edge for faster responses

### Common Global Deployment Issues & Fixes

**Issue: SSL certificate fails to issue**
```bash
# Check cert-manager logs
kubectl logs deployment/cert-manager -n cert-manager

# Verify DNS is pointing to your cluster
dig game.yourdomain.com

# Check certificate challenge status
kubectl describe certificate gameapp-prod-tls -n humor-game
```

**Issue: Cloudflare shows "Error 522"**
```bash
# Connection timeout - check your origin server
kubectl get pods -n humor-game
kubectl get svc -n humor-game

# Verify ingress controller is responding
kubectl logs deployment/ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx
```

**Issue: Cache not working effectively**
```bash
# Check cache headers
curl -I https://game.yourdomain.com/api/health

### Step 1.2 — Verify Services

**Service verification commands:**
```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View service logs
docker compose logs --tail=50

# Test API health endpoint
curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

**Expected results:**
- All 5 services showing "Up" status
- Backend health endpoint returning HTTP 200
- Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000

### Step 1.3 — Test Endpoints

**Frontend test:**
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000/
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

**API health test:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health | jq .
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", "services": {...}}
```

### ✅ Checkpoint

- [x] All 5 services running and healthy
- [x] Frontend accessible at localhost:3000
- [x] API health endpoint responding with 200 OK
- [x] Database and Redis connections established
- [x] Nginx reverse proxy routing correctly

### Critical Issues Fixed

**1. Backend Catch-All Route Issue:**
- **Problem:** Backend had `app.use('*', ...)` that intercepted all frontend requests
- **Error:** "This is an API-only server. Frontend is served separately! 🎮"
- **Fix:** Commented out the problematic catch-all route
- **File:** `backend/server.js` - removed `app.use('*', ...)` route

**2. Nginx Proxy Configuration Issue:**
- **Problem:** `proxy_pass http://backend:3001/;` had trailing slash causing routing errors
- **Error:** API endpoints returning 404 (e.g., `/api/leaderboard`)
- **Fix:** Changed to `proxy_pass http://backend:3001;` (no trailing slash)
- **File:** `nginx-reverse-proxy.conf`

**3. Frontend Environment Variable Substitution:**
- **Problem:** HTML template variables not being processed by `envsubst`
- **Error:** `window.API_BASE_URL = '${API_BASE_URL}'` not substituted
- **Fix:** Updated template syntax and startup script
- **Files:** `frontend/src/index.html`, `frontend/Dockerfile`

**4. JavaScript Alert Popup Issue:**
- **Problem:** `alert('🎯 JavaScript executed successfully!')` showing on every refresh
- **Fix:** Commented out the alert statement
- **File:** `frontend/src/scripts/game.js`

**5. JavaScript Configuration Race Condition:**
- **Problem:** JavaScript trying to access `window.API_BASE_URL` before it was set
- **Error:** "Cannot Connect to Game Server" in browser
- **Fix:** Added `waitForConfig()` function with async/await pattern
- **File:** `frontend/src/scripts/game.js`

### Regression Guards Implemented

**Created `scripts/regression-guards.sh` to prevent future regressions:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Regression Guards for Milestone 1 Fixes

# 1) Backend: no catch-all route that swallows frontend paths
if grep -R "^\\s*app\.use(\\s*'\\*'" backend 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: catch-all route present in backend"
    exit 1
fi

# 2) Backend: /api/health exists and responds in container
if ! grep -R "/api/health" backend; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: /api/health route not found in backend"
    exit 1
fi

# 3) Nginx: no trailing slash in proxy_pass
if ! grep -R "proxy_pass\\s\\+http://backend:3001;" nginx-reverse-proxy.conf; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: proxy_pass not exact"
    exit 1
fi

# 4) Frontend: no alert() left in shipped code
if grep -R "^\\s*alert(" frontend/src; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: alert() found in frontend code"
    exit 1
fi

# 5) Env var/startup template syntax fixed
if grep -R "{{.*}}" frontend/src; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: template placeholders remain"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Container restarting loops:**
- **Cause:** Health check failures or dependency issues
- **Fix:** Check logs with `docker compose logs <service>`
- **Prevention:** Proper health check configuration and service dependencies

**Backend can't reach database:**
- **Cause:** Network configuration or service discovery issues
- **Fix:** Verify `depends_on` and network configuration in docker-compose.yml
- **Prevention:** Use proper Docker networks and service names

**Frontend not loading:**
- **Cause:** Nginx configuration or port conflicts
- **Fix:** Check nginx logs and verify port mappings
- **Prevention:** Regression guards and proper nginx configuration

**Environment variables not working:**
- **Cause:** Template syntax or startup script issues
- **Fix:** Verify `envsubst` syntax and startup script execution
- **Prevention:** Template validation and startup script testing
